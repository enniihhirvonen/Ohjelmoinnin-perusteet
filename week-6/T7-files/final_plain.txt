Part 0 - year of the four emperors:
in ad 68, after nero's death, rome plunged into chaos
with no clear heir, the empire saw rapid power struggles.
galba took the throne first, followed by otho, vitellius, and finally vespasian,
each battling for control in what became the year of the four emperors.
